## **This code is left as a historical record but if you wish to do growth prediction please use new [`gRodon2`](https://github.com/jlw-ecoevo/gRodon2) which has an updated (and much improved) metagenome_v2 mode and can also predict max growth rates for eukaryotic microbes at [`https://github.com/jlw-ecoevo/gRodon2`](https://github.com/jlw-ecoevo/gRodon2). Code in this repository is no longer updated/maintained (whereas [`gRodon2`](https://github.com/jlw-ecoevo/gRodon2) is maintained)**
